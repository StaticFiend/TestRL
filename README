Roguelike using libtcod 1.5.0,  please visit http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/ to download a copy of the library,
though the include files are already included with this release.  See LIBTCOD-LICENSE.txt for the appropriate
licensing for use.

Has been tested on a ASUS EEE clocked at 1.6GHz and 1GB of RAM, using OpenSuSE 11.3 x86_64.  Should work fine
under any flavor of Linux, and should work perfectly fine under Windows, but I have yet to test that as of
3/1/2011.

Current Progress:
[3/9/11] Initial commit of this progress.

*       Loading a map from file is working properly.
*       Bottom HUD system works. (hp/mp bars go down properly, etc)
        Needs proper stats from player in there and other things.
*       FOV system is working
*       Movement and collision with map works.
*       Distance between two points formula works.
*       Saving on stairs works (saves most information necessary, last few things aren't in yet)
*       Doors open/close properly.
*       Switched entire map system to 2D arrays.
*       Have cave randomized maps working in a separate test example, should be easy to implement
        into the full program since things are 2D arrays now.
*       Cave system fully implemented into main program.
