This is sort of pseudo code for developing a more robust map system, this file may change rapidly

Possibly make a TCOD_color_t array for having each map tiles color stored, this way we can make multiple tiles
a slight variation in color without needing to compute this during rendering.

main:
create char array for map[HEIGHT * WIDTH]
create TCOD_map_t for fov/pathfinding with MAP_WIDTH, MAP_HEIGHT dimensions
pass map array to a function for writing a file to it
pass map array and TCOD_map to a function for building the data necessary for fov/pathfinding
compute fov
pass map array and TCOD_map for drawing to the main console

getMapFromFile:
load .map file
use the fgetc function and load the entire file to the array
convert any \n or unknown ASCII (-1) to 35's (#)
assign player spawn position from ASCII code 64 (@) and assign 46 (.) there for drawing

createTCODmap:
start a giant for loop for the map array
read in the array
any tile with the ASCII codes 35 (#) or 43 (+) is blocking
all other tiles do not block

r_drawMap:
for loop for array
draw tiles to screen with TCOD_console_put_char_ex
compute color with TCOD_map_is_in_fov
