Roguelike using libtcod 1.5.0,  please visit http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/ to download a copy of the library,
though the include/library files are already included with this release for ease of compiling.
LIBTCOD-LICENSE.txt is included as well in this release, please read it if you wish to use libtcod in a project.

TestRL has been tested on a ASUS EEE clocked at 1.6GHz and 1GB of RAM, using OpenSuSE 11.3 (and 11.4) x86_64.
Should work fine under any flavor of Linux, and should work perfectly fine under Windows, 
but I have yet to test that as of 3/1/2011.  If you need to compile this for 32-bit the 32-bit library is also included.

Windows users, to compile you'll need MinGW and the libtcod library from the website above.
You'll need gcc and make.

Current Progress:
[2011/3/14]

*	Added a light system for the player in dark caves.
*	Added lifespan to torches (80 turns right now, will have a system of restoring this later).

[2011/3/9] Initial commit of this progress.

*       Loading a map from file is working properly.
*       Bottom HUD system works. (hp/mp bars go down properly, etc)
        Needs proper stats from player in there and other things.
*       FOV system is working
*       Movement and collision with map works.
*       Distance between two points formula works.
*       Saving on stairs works (saves most information necessary, last few things aren't in yet)
*       Doors open/close properly.
*       Switched entire map system to 2D arrays.
*       Have cave randomized maps working in a separate test example, should be easy to implement
        into the full program since things are 2D arrays now.
*       Cave system fully implemented into main program.
