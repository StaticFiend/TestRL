Roguelike using libtcod 1.5.0,  please visit http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/ to download a copy of the library,
though the include files are already included with this release.  See LIBTCOD-LICENSE.txt for the appropriate
licensing for use.

Has been tested on a ASUS EEE clocked at 1.6GHz and 1GB of RAM, using OpenSuSE 11.3 x86_64.  Should work fine
under any flavor of Linux, and should work perfectly fine under Windows, but I have yet to test that as of
3/1/2011.
